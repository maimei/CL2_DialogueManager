# CL2_DialogueManager
The dialogue manager is part of a project in computer linguistics, where we created a dialog system that would support you cooking a recipe. 
The system was composed of diffrent components such as 
- the natural language processor
- the dialogue manager which takes parses natural language utterances and logically processes them 
- the natural language synthesiser, who produces a natural language response. 

I was repsonbile for developing the entire dialogue manager.
